This repository contains all necessary files being used in my Master's Thesis. It includes Python and Matlab code, text files with evaluation data, and figures used in the thesis. Important to note is the h5-file in NN_Model_AugmInput and NN_Model_SF. This is the saved Tensorflow model and can be reloaded for future use. The folder NN_Numpy contains a Numpy implementation of a neural network and is used to demonstrate the capabilities of neural networks as universal approximator. The folder NN_Model_SF contains the first Tensorflow model where the relationship wake velocity profile to force coefficient is statically modelled. The folder NN_Model_AugmInput contains the second Tensorflow model which models explicit dynamics by using the extra 2 delayed timesteps as input to the model.



The repository will be made read-only available.
